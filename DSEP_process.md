# **DataJoint Specs Enhancement Proposal Process (DSEP)**  

This document outlines the process for proposing enhancements, modifications, or improvements to the **DataJoint Specs**.

## **1. Overview**  
The **DataJoint Specs Enhancement Proposal (DSEP)** process ensures that improvements are **well-documented, reviewed, and systematically integrated** into the specification. It provides a structured approach for **submitting, discussing, and approving changes**.

---

## **2. When to Submit a DSEP?**  
A DSEP is required for:  
- **Major additions or modifications** to the specification.  
- **Breaking changes** that impact compatibility.  
- **Significant clarifications or structural improvements**.  
- **Changes to best practices or implementation guidelines**.  

Minor updates, such as typo corrections or formatting improvements, can be submitted directly via a **GitHub Issue or Pull Request** without a formal DSEP.

---

## **3. Drafting a Proposal**  
All DSEPs should follow a standard format to ensure clarity and consistency.

### **DSEP Template**
Each proposal should be documented using the following template:

```markdown
# DSEP-XXX: [Title]
## **Author(s):** [Name(s), GitHub Handle(s)]
## **Status:** [Draft | Under Review | Accepted | Rejected | Withdrawn]
## **Created:** [Date]
## **Last Updated:** [Date]
## **Abstract**  
A short summary of the proposed enhancement.

## **Motivation**  
Why is this change needed? What problem does it solve?

## **Specification**  
A detailed technical description of the proposed change. If modifying an existing spec, specify which section(s) are affected.

## **Backwards Compatibility**  
Will this change break existing implementations? If so, how should transitions be handled?

## **Alternatives Considered**  
Other approaches considered and why they were rejected.

## **Implementation Strategy**  
Steps required to implement this proposal. Who will implement it?

## **Unresolved Questions**  
Any open issues or concerns requiring further discussion.
```

---

## **4. Submitting a Proposal**  

DSEPs should be submitted via **GitHub Issues or Pull Requests** in the **DataJoint Specs repository**.

### **Submission Guidelines**
- **Minor proposals** (e.g., documentation improvements): Open a **GitHub Issue**.
- **Major proposals** (e.g., API changes, structural revisions):  
  - Open a **Pull Request** with a new file in the `dseps/` directory.  
  - Use the naming convention: `dsep-XXX-title.md` (replace `XXX` with the proposal number).  

---

## **5. Review & Discussion**  
Once submitted, the DSEP enters a **review phase**, where:  
- **Community members and maintainers** discuss the proposal.  
- The author revises the proposal based on feedback.  
- Meetings or discussions may be scheduled for complex proposals.  

---

## **6. Decision & Approval**  
After review, the proposal is either:  
‚úÖ **Accepted** ‚Äì It moves to implementation.  
‚ùå **Rejected** ‚Äì A justification is provided, and alternatives may be suggested.  
üîÑ **Revised** ‚Äì Sent back for further refinement.  
üö´ **Withdrawn** ‚Äì The author withdraws it based on feedback.  

Accepted proposals are merged into the repository under `dseps/`, while rejected proposals remain documented for future reference.

---

## **7. Implementation & Tracking**  
Once a DSEP is accepted:  
- A **GitHub Issue or Project Board entry** is created to track progress.  
- A **branch or Pull Request** is opened for implementation.  
- A final review ensures the proposal is correctly integrated before merging into the official specification.  

---

## **8. Why This Process?**  
‚úÖ Ensures **structured, well-documented proposals** before implementation.  
‚úÖ Encourages **community involvement** and prevents ad hoc changes.  
‚úÖ Maintains a **historical record of decisions** for future reference.  
‚úÖ Balances **agility with stability** for evolving the specification effectively.

For minor contributions or clarifications, please open a **GitHub Issue** instead of a full DSEP.
